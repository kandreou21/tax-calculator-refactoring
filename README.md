# Refactoring of Existing Java Project

The primary goal of this refactoring effort is to enhance the overall quality of the Java project by restructuring and optimizing its codebase. Refactoring involves modifying the existing code to make it cleaner, more understandable, and easier to maintain without altering its external behavior.

## Refactoring Techniques Used

- **Extract Method**: Break down large methods into smaller, more manageable ones to improve readability and maintainability.
  
- **Rename Variables and Methods**: Use meaningful names that accurately describe their purpose and functionality.
  
- **Eliminate Code Duplication**: Identify duplicated code segments and refactor them into reusable functions or classes.
  
- **Optimize Data Structures**: Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to improve performance where applicable.

- **Remove Middle Man**: Remove methods that simple delegate calls to respective methods. 

- **Improve GUI**: Replace the old GUI with a new one that is easier to learn and use.
